# 👋 Hi, I’m Adam Reznik

I’m a **Senior Product Designer** focused on building **complex, scalable digital products** with strong emphasis on **design systems, semantic tokens, and system-level UX**.

I work at the intersection of **user research, interaction design, and implementation-ready UI**, bridging design and front-end workflows.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

I design products that are:
- **systematic, scalable, and maintainable**
- grounded in **real user problems and research**
- ready for **handoff to engineering without friction**

My work focuses on:
- complex UX flows and information architecture  
- design systems driven by **semantic tokens**  
- consistency across platforms (web & mobile)  
- close alignment between design and code

---

## 🧩 UX & Product Design

- User research (qualitative & exploratory)
- Jobs-to-be-Done thinking
- User flows & journey mapping
- Wireframing (low → mid fidelity)
- Interactive prototyping
- Usability validation
- Design rationale & documentation

I pay particular attention to **edge cases, states, constraints, and system behavior**, not just happy paths.

## 🎨 Design Systems & UI Engineering

- Design systems architecture
- Semantic tokens (color, typography, spacing, states)
- Platform-aware tokens (web / mobile)
- Component logic and variants
- Accessibility-aware UI decisions
- Design → code alignment

I treat design systems as **living products**, not static libraries.
